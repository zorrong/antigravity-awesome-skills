# 🤝 Contributing Guide - V4 Enterprise Edition

**Thank you for wanting to make this repo better!** This guide shows you exactly how to contribute, even if you're new to open source.
With V4, we raised the bar for quality. Please read the **new Quality Standards** below carefully.

## 🧐 The "Quality Bar" (V4 Standard)

**Critical for new skills:** Every skill submitted must pass our **5-Point Quality Check** (see `docs/QUALITY_BAR.md` for details):

1.  **Metadata**: Correct Frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
2.  **Safety**: No harmful commands without "Risk" labels.
3.  **Clarity**: Clear "When to use" section.
4.  **Examples**: At least one copy-paste usage example.
5.  **Actions**: Must define concrete steps, not just "thoughts".

## How to Create a New Skill

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Choose Your Skill Topic

Ask yourself: "What do I wish my AI assistant knew better?".
Example: "I'm good at Docker, let me create a Docker skill".

#### Step 2: Create the Folder Structure

Skills live in the `skills/` directory. Use `kebab-case` for folder names.

```bash
# Navigate to skills
cd skills/

# Create your skill folder
mkdir my-awesome-skill
cd my-awesome-skill

# Create the SKILL.md file
touch SKILL.md
```

#### Step 3: Write Your SKILL.md

Every skill needs this basic structure. **Copy this template:**

```markdown
---
name: my-awesome-skill
description: "Brief one-line description of what this skill does"
---

# Skill Title

## Overview

Explain what this skill does and when to use it.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when [scenario 1]
- Use when [scenario 2]

## How It Works

## Examples

### Example 1

\`\`\`
code example here
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

- ✅ Do this
- ❌ Don't do this
```

#### Step 4: Validate (CRITICAL V4 STEP)

Use the canonical validator `scripts/validate_skills.py` via `npm run validate`. **We will not merge PRs that fail this check.**

```bash
npm run validate        # soft mode (warnings only)
npm run validate:strict # strict mode (what CI runs)
```

This checks:

- ✅ `SKILL.md` exists
- ✅ Frontmatter is correct
- ✅ Name matches folder name
- ✅ Quality Bar checks passed

#### Step 5: Submit Your Skill

```bash
git add skills/my-awesome-skill/
git commit -m "feat: add my-awesome-skill"
git push origin my-branch
```
