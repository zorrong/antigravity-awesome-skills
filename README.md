## New Here? Start Here!

**Welcome to the V4.0.0 Enterprise Edition.** This isn't just a list of scripts; it's a complete operating system for your AI Agent.

### 1. 🐣 Context: What is this?

**Antigravity Awesome Skills** (Release 4.0.0) is a massive upgrade to your AI's capabilities.

AI Agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, or Gemini) are smart, but they lack **specific tools**. They don't know your company's "Deployment Protocol" or the specific syntax for "AWS CloudFormation".
**Skills** are small markdown files that teach them how to do these specific tasks perfectly, every time.

### 2. ⚡️ Quick Start (The "Bundle" Way)

Don't install 552+ skills manually. Use our **Starter Packs**:

1.  **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
    ```
2.  **Pick your persona** (See [docs/BUNDLES.md](docs/BUNDLES.md)):
    - **Web Dev?** use the `Web Wizard` pack.
    - **Hacker?** use the `Security Engineer` pack.
    - **Just curious?** start with `Essentials`.

### 3. 🧠 How to use

Once installed, just ask your agent naturally:

> "Use the **@brainstorming** skill to help me plan a SaaS."
> "Run **@lint-and-validate** on this file."

👉 **[Read the Full Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)**

## Compatibility & Invocation

These skills follow the universal **SKILL.md** format and work with any AI coding assistant that supports agentic skills.

| Tool            | Type | Invocation Example                | Path              |
| :-------------- | :--- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| **Claude Code** | CLI  | `>> /skill-name help me...`       | `.claude/skills/` |
| **Gemini CLI**  | CLI  | `(User Prompt) Use skill-name...` | `.gemini/skills/` |
| **Antigravity** | IDE  | `(Agent Mode) Use skill...`       | `.agent/skills/`  |
| **Cursor**      | IDE  | `@skill-name (in Chat)`           | `.cursor/skills/` |
| **Copilot**     | Ext  | `(Paste content manually)`        | N/A               |

> [!TIP]
> **Universal Path**: We recommend cloning to `.agent/skills/`. Most modern tools (Antigravity, recent CLIs) look here by default.

> [!WARNING]
> **Windows Users**: This repository uses **symlinks** for official skills.
> You must enable Developer Mode or run Git as Administrator:
> `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/...`
