# Getting Started with Antigravity Awesome Skills (V3)

**New here? This guide will help you supercharge your AI Agent in 5 minutes.**

## 🤔 What Are "Skills"?

AI Agents (like **Claude Code**, **Gemini**, **Cursor**) are smart, but they lack specific knowledge about your tools.
**Skills** are specialized instruction manuals (markdown files) that teach your AI how to perform specific tasks perfectly, every time.

**Analogy:** Your AI is a brilliant intern. **Skills** are the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) that make them a Senior Engineer.

## ⚡️ Quick Start: The "Starter Packs"

Don't panic about the 552+ skills. You don't need them all at once.
We have curated **Starter Packs** to get you running immediately.

### 1. Install the Repo

Copy the skills to your agent's folder:

```bash
# Universal Installation (works for most agents)
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
```

### 2. Pick Your Persona

Find the bundle that matches your role (see [BUNDLES.md](BUNDLES.md)):

| Persona               | Bundle Name    | What's Inside?                                    |
| :-------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |

## 🚀 How to Use a Skill

Once installed, just talk to your AI naturally.

### Example 1: Planning a Feature (**Essentials**)

> "Use **@brainstorming** to help me design a new login flow."

**What happens:** The AI loads the brainstorming skill, asks you structured questions, and produces a professional spec.

### Example 2: Checking Your Code (**Web Wizard**)

> "Run **@lint-and-validate** on this file and fix errors."

**What happens:** The AI follows strict linting rules defined in the skill to clean your code.

### Example 3: Security Audit (**Hacker Pack**)

> "Use **@api-security-best-practices** to review my API endpoints."

**What happens:** The AI audits your code against OWASP standards.
