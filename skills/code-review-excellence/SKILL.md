# Code Review Excellence

Transform code reviews from gatekeeping to knowledge sharing through constructive feedback, systematic analysis, and collaborative improvement.

## Use this skill when

- Reviewing pull requests and code changes
- Establishing code review standards
- Mentoring developers through review feedback
- Auditing for correctness, security, or performance

## Do not use this skill when

- There are no code changes to review
- The task is a design-only discussion without code
- You need to implement fixes instead of reviewing

## Instructions

- Read context, requirements, and test signals first.
- Review for correctness, security, performance, and maintainability.
- Provide actionable feedback with severity and rationale.
- Ask clarifying questions when intent is unclear.
- If detailed checklists are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Output Format

- High-level summary of findings
- Issues grouped by severity (blocking, important, minor)
- Suggestions and questions
- Test and coverage notes

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed review patterns and templates.
