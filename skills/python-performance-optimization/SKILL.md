# Python Performance Optimization

Comprehensive guide to profiling, analyzing, and optimizing Python code for better performance, including CPU profiling, memory optimization, and implementation best practices.

## Use this skill when

- Identifying performance bottlenecks in Python applications
- Reducing application latency and response times
- Optimizing CPU-intensive operations
- Reducing memory consumption and memory leaks
- Improving database query performance
- Optimizing I/O operations
- Speeding up data processing pipelines
- Implementing high-performance algorithms
- Profiling production applications

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to python performance optimization
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.
