### Total Compensation Formula

```
Total Comp = Base Salary × 1.30 (benefits & taxes) + Equity Value
```

**Fully-Loaded Cost:**
- Base salary
- Payroll taxes (7.65% FICA)
- Benefits (health insurance, 401k): $10K-$15K per employee
- Other (workspace, equipment, software): $5K-$10K per employee

**Rule of Thumb:** Multiply base salary by 1.3-1.4 for fully-loaded cost

### Geographic Adjustments

**San Francisco / New York:** +20-30% above benchmarks
**Seattle / Boston / Los Angeles:** +10-20%
**Austin / Denver / Chicago:** +0-10%
**Remote / Other US Cities:** -10-20%
**International:** Varies widely by country

## Equity Allocation

### Equity by Role and Stage

**Founders:**
- First founder: 40-60%
- Second founder: 20-40%
- Third founder: 10-20%
- Vesting: 4 years with 1-year cliff

**Early Employees (Pre-Seed):**
- First engineer: 0.5-2.0%
- First 5 employees: 0.25-1.0% each

**Seed Stage Hires:**
- VP/Head level: 0.5-1.5%
- Senior IC: 0.1-0.5%
- Mid-level: 0.05-0.25%
- Junior: 0.01-0.1%

**Series A Hires:**
- C-level (CTO, CFO): 1.0-3.0%
- VP level: 0.3-1.0%
- Director level: 0.1-0.5%
- Senior IC: 0.05-0.2%
- Mid-level: 0.01-0.1%
- Junior: 0.005-0.05%

### Equity Pool Sizing

**Option Pool by Round:**
- Pre-Seed: 10-15% reserved
- Seed: 10-15% top-up
- Series A: 10-15% top-up
- Series B+: 5-10% per round

**Pre-Funding Dilution:**
Investors often require option pool creation before investment, diluting founders.

**Example:**
```
Pre-money: $10M
Investors want 15% option pool post-money

Calculation:
Post-money: $15M ($10M + $5M investment)
Option pool: $2.25M (15% × $15M)
Founders diluted by pool creation before new money
```

## Organizational Design

### Reporting Structure

**Pre-Seed:**
```
Founders (flat structure)
├── Contractors
└── First hires (report to founders)
```

**Seed:**
```
CEO
├── Engineering Lead (2-4 engineers)
├── Sales/Growth Lead (1-2 reps)
├── Product Manager
└── Operations
```

**Series A:**
```
CEO
├── CTO / VP Engineering (6-20 people)
│   ├── Engineering Manager(s)
│   └── Individual Contributors
├── VP Sales (5-15 people)
│   ├── Sales Manager
│   ├── Account Executives
│   └── SDRs
├── Head of Product (2-5 people)
│   ├── Product Managers
│   └── Designers
├── Head of Customer Success (2-5 people)
└── CFO / Finance Lead (2-5 people)
    ├── Recruiter
    └── Operations
```

### Span of Control

**Manager Ratios:**
- First-line managers: 4-8 direct reports
- Directors: 3-5 direct reports (managers)
- VPs: 3-5 direct reports (directors)
- CEO: 5-8 direct reports (executive team)

## Full-Time vs. Contract

### Use Full-Time for:
- Core product development
- Sales (revenue-generating roles)
- Mission-critical operations
- Institutional knowledge roles

### Use Contractors for:
- Specialized short-term needs (legal, accounting)
- Variable workload (design, marketing campaigns)
- Skills outside core competency
- Testing role before FTE hire
- Geographic expansion before permanent presence

### Cost Comparison

**Full-Time:**
- Lower hourly cost
- Benefits and overhead
- Long-term commitment
- Cultural fit matters

**Contract:**
- Higher hourly rate ($75-$200/hour vs. $40-$100/hour FTE equivalent)
- No benefits or overhead
- Flexible engagement
- Easier to scale up/down

## Hiring Velocity

### Realistic Timeline

**Role Opening to Hire:**
- Junior: 6-8 weeks
- Mid-Level: 8-12 weeks
- Senior: 12-16 weeks
- Executive: 16-24 weeks

**Time to Productivity:**
- Junior: 4-6 months
- Mid-Level: 2-4 months
- Senior: 1-3 months
- Executive: 3-6 months

### Planning Buffer

Always add 2-3 months buffer to hiring plans.

**Example:**
If need engineer by July 1:
- Start recruiting: April 1 (12 weeks)
- Productivity: September 1 (2 months ramp)

## Budget Planning

### Compensation as % of Revenue

**Early Stage (Seed):**
- Total comp: 120-150% of revenue (burning cash to grow)
- Engineering: 50-60%
- Sales: 30-40%
- Other: 20-30%

**Growth Stage (Series A):**
- Total comp: 70-100% of revenue
- Engineering: 35-45%
- Sales: 25-35%
- Other: 20-30%

### Headcount Budget Formula

```
Total Comp Budget = Σ (Role Count × Fully-Loaded Cost × % of Year)

Example:
3 Engineers × $202K × 100% = $606K
2 AEs × $230K × 75% (mid-year start) = $345K
1 PM × $162K × 100% = $162K
Total: $1.1M
```

## Quick Start

To plan team composition:

1. **Identify stage** - Pre-seed, seed, or Series A
2. **Define roles** - What functions are needed now
3. **Prioritize hires** - Critical path for business goals
4. **Set compensation** - Base salary + equity by level
5. **Plan timeline** - Account for recruiting and ramp time
6. **Calculate budget** - Fully-loaded cost × headcount
7. **Design org chart** - Reporting structure and span of control
8. **Allocate equity** - Fair allocation that preserves pool
