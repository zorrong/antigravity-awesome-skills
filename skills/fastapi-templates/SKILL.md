# FastAPI Project Templates

Production-ready FastAPI project structures with async patterns, dependency injection, middleware, and best practices for building high-performance APIs.

## Use this skill when

- Starting new FastAPI projects from scratch
- Implementing async REST APIs with Python
- Building high-performance web services and microservices
- Creating async applications with PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Setting up API projects with proper structure and testing

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to fastapi project templates
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.
