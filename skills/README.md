# Skills Directory

**Welcome to the skills folder!** This is where all 179+ specialized AI skills live.

## 🤔 What Are Skills?

Skills are specialized instruction sets that teach AI assistants how to handle specific tasks. Think of them as expert knowledge modules that your AI can load on-demand.

**Simple analogy:** Just like you might consult different experts (a designer, a security expert, a marketer), skills let your AI become an expert in different areas when you need them.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each skill lives in its own folder with this structure:

```
skills/
├── skill-name/              # Individual skill folder
│   ├── SKILL.md             # Main skill definition (required)
│   ├── scripts/             # Helper scripts (optional)
│   ├── examples/            # Usage examples (optional)
│   └── resources/           # Templates & resources (optional)
```

**Key point:** Only `SKILL.md` is required. Everything else is optional!
