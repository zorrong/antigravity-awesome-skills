# Rule Name

## Iron Law

**[SINGLE SENTENCE ABSOLUTE RULE]**

Violating the letter IS violating the spirit.

## The Rule

1. ALWAYS [step 1]
2. NEVER [step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Violations

[Action before rule]? **Delete it. Start over.**

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it
- Delete means delete

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple" | Simple code breaks. Rule takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll do it after" | After = never. Do it now. |
| "Spirit not ritual" | The ritual IS the spirit. |

## Red Flags - STOP

- [Flag 1]
- [Flag 2]
- "This is different because..."

**All mean:** Delete. Start over.

## Valid Exceptions

- [Exception 1]
- [Exception 2]

**Everything else:** Follow the rule.
